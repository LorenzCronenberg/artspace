This is a clone of AirBnB using art-pieces. This means art-pieces can be shown, booked by other users, as well as edited and deleted by the creators. Moreover, each user has its own profile page summarizing all information about his activity on ARTSPACE. 

ARTSPACE was a 1-week project of a group of four Le Wagon alumnis during the Web-Development Bootcamp.
